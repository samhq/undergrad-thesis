## Abstract

Facial expression analysis is rapidly becoming an area of intense interest in computer science and human-computer interaction design communities. The most expressive way humans display emotions is through facial expressions. This thesis presents the development of a facial expression recognition system that takes any frontal image of any human face and finds the emotion expressed by that person. We have developed a method which is implemented using eigenface-based approach for the extraction of intransient facial features and recognition of five facial expressions. The algorithm implements principal component analysis and further uses for feature extraction and creates eigenface representation of the face, followed by classification into one of the expression classes. The algorithm achieves an accuracy of 77% for facial expression recognition for normalised color image.
